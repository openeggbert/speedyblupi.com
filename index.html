    <p>The game is set in a central hub from which players can access seven different themed worlds. Each world presents unique challenges and treasure hunting quests. The protagonist, Blupi (or Eggbert), must navigate through these worlds, overcoming obstacles and solving puzzles while avoiding multi-colored Blupis who guard each hub world.</p>
    <p>Speedy Blupi features over forty levels of varying difficulty. The main goal in each level is to collect all treasure chests and reach the endpoint. Players encounter enemies that cannot be destroyed by normal means but can be tackled using special tools such as the Helicopter, Glue Tank, and yellow mines.</p>
